The GemHunter Tool is a comprehensive trading assistant designed to enhance your trading strategy by combining advanced technical analysis with clear, actionable insights. Below is a detailed guide to the various metrics and visual indicators provided by the tool.

### **Seamless Integration with MACD Integration**

While powerful on its own, the GemHunter Tool truly shines when paired with the MACD Integration for GemHunter, enabling you to harness the full potential of trend momentum and divergence detection. Together, they form a robust ecosystem for professional-grade trading.

### **Features & Indicators**

1. **Support and Resistance Lines:**
   These lines automatically identify and lock in the most important support and resistance levels based on historical price action. These levels are crucial for planning your entries and exits. Support lines represent price levels where the asset tends to find buying interest, while resistance lines represent price levels where selling pressure tends to emerge.

   **Precision Control:** You can adjust the precision with which these lines are identified, allowing for fine-tuned analysis based on your preferred trading style.

2. The background color on your chart changes dynamically to reflect the momentum of the market, as determined by a MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) crossover strategy:

   - **Green Background:** Indicates a bullish trend or upward momentum when the faster MACD line crosses above the slower MACD line.
   - **Red Background:** Indicates a bearish trend or downward momentum when the faster MACD line crosses below the slower MACD line.

3. **Trend Change Arrows:** These arrows are plotted on the chart to visually indicate a shift in market direction:
   - **Upward Green Arrow (▲):** Appears when the tool detects the beginning of an Uptrend (price above certain moving averages, such as the Ichimoku spans and EMA).
   - **Downward Red Arrow (▼):** Appears when the tool detects the start of a Downtrend (price below key moving averages).

4. **Average Trend Duration:** This table on bottom left tracks the average duration of uptrends and downtrends over the past 365 bars (or roughly 1 year of daily data). Knowing the typical trend duration can help you better time your entries and exits.
   - **Average Uptrend Duration:** Shows the average length of time (in bars) that price has been moving upward before reversing.
   - **Average Downtrend Duration:** Shows the average length of time that price has been moving downward before reversing.

5. **Current Trend:** This table on bottom right displays the current trend of the market based on multiple timeframes (short-term and long-term):
   - **Uptrend:** If the current price is above both the Senkou Span A and Senkou Span B (Ichimoku-style metrics), it indicates an uptrend.
   - **Downtrend:** If the price is below both the Senkou spans, it indicates a downtrend.
   - **Neutral:** If neither uptrend nor downtrend conditions are met, it will show as neutral.

6. **Short/Long-Term Trends:** This table displays the current strength of short-term and long-term trends based on EMA (Exponential Moving Averages) over different time periods:
   - **Long-Term Trend:** The long-term trend is assessed using 365-day EMA (daily chart) and 365-day EMA (4-hour chart), showing the strength of the overall market movement over a year.
   - **Short-Term Trend:** The short-term trend is evaluated using 90-day EMA (daily chart) and 90-day EMA (4-hour chart), showing the strength of the trend over a shorter period.

   **The Strength Indicators:**
   - **Bullish:** If the price is well above the moving average, the trend is considered bullish.
   - **Neutral:** If the price is near the moving average, it indicates a neutral trend.
   - **Bearish:** If the price is well below the moving average, the trend is bearish.

   The strength of these trends is visually represented in the table and is color-coded:
   - **Green:** Strong bullish trend
   - **Black:** Neutral or weak trend
   - **Red:** Strong bearish trend

7. **EMA Indicators:** This tool also includes multiple EMAs across various timeframes, providing a comprehensive view of market trends. These EMAs are used to determine trend strength and potential reversal points, with each line offering a unique perspective based on the timeframe it covers.

   - **Short-term EMAs** (8D / 150h, 21D / 365h)
   - **Mid-term EMAs** (50D, 200D, 1W, 1M)
   - **Long-term EMAs** (365-day EMA and 4-hour chart)  


### **How to Use:**

To use the GemHunter Tool, simply add it to your chart [copy & paste pine script here](https://github.com/Finland93/GemHunter/blob/main/GemHunter/gemhunter.pine), and it will automatically plot key support and resistance lines, trend arrows, and trend strength tables. You can customize the tool by adjusting parameters such as Fast Length, Slow Length, and Signal Length to tailor the indicators to your preferred trading style.

Once the tool is applied, monitor the visual indicators. Look for a green or red background, which signals momentum shifts, and keep an eye out for upward (▲) or downward (▼) arrows that indicate trend changes. Additionally, refer to the trend strength tables. The bottom-left table will show the average trend duration, while the bottom-right table will provide the current trend status, allowing you to assess the market conditions. Lastly, use the top-right table to gauge the strength of both short-term (90 days) and long-term (365 days) trends, giving you a comprehensive view of the market’s movement.
